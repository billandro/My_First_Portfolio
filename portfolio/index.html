            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I am Bill Qubeka, a junior software engineer who specialises in Javascript and Python. I received my technical training at ALX (Front-End Software Engineering), wethinkcode (Software Programming), and Harvard University (Introduction to Computer Science). I have used my technical skills to build working applications (Sqlite, Flask, and Python), and functioning and responsive websites (HTML, CSS, and Javascript). I recieved both of my certificates from Harvard University and ALX with an average of 75%+ respectively. My goal is to work for a company whose mission is to improve the lives of individuals on the African continent. A company who constantly challenges their employees through exposure to different technologies in the software engineering space.
